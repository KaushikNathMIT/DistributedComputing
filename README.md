#Distributed Processing System
This project allows a client to send a dataset to a central server and specify what operation needs to be performed on the dataset. The central server then distributes the dataset to an arbitrary number of worker servers and combines the results of each worker server, which is sent to the client. C++, Sockets and POSIX Threads have been used in this project.
